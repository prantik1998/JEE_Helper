# Test Papers Design and ToDo

So I(credits - Prantik) suggested that we make a Google Form kind of interface for creating question papers.

Question Papers have usually only these components - 

1) Question (Text)
2) Question (Diagram, which can have graphs or Drawings but we are ignoring that for now)
3) Answer (Type - MCQ, multiple answer, integer type, subjective)
4) Answer (Choices(If applicable))
5) Subject
6) Marks

We can provide a real-time rendering mechanism for the papers, everytime a new question is created.
A real-time rendering of the OMR can also be done

This will have an interface similar to latex with the rendered view on the right and the editable questions on the left

Functionalities which will be provided will be-

- [ ] Download as pdf
- [ ] Download as docx
- [ ] Automatic Clubbing of subject questions
- [ ] Automatic Clubbing of Answer on the basis of Type
- [ ] Automatic same marks for same type questions but should be editable
- [ ] Automatic new question should have same subject, marks, answer(Type) as previous question
- [ ] Should be saved and be editable
- [ ] Should be sharable between multiple users
